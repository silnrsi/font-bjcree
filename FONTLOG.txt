FONTLOG
BJCree font
===========

This file provides detailed information on the BJCree font software.
This information should be distributed along with the BJCree fonts
and any derivative works.


Basic Font Information
----------------------

The BJCree typeface was originally designed in conjunction with the Naskapi
community in the 1990s. When it was subsequently re-encoded for Unicode,
coverage was extended for all the Cree (and Ojibwa) languages. Thus all the
“Algonquian” language family languages that use Unified Canadian Aboriginal
Syllabics are covered by the BJCree glyph inventory. That is,
Plains Cree [crk], Woods Cree [cwd], Swampy Cree [csw], Moose Cree [crm],
East Cree Southern [crj], East Cree Northern [crl], Naskapi [nsk],
Severn Ojibwe (Oji-Cree) [ojs], and Northwestern Ojibwe [ojb].
