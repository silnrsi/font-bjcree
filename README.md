# BJCree font family

Canadian Syllabics fonts for the Algonquian family of languages.

The BJCree typeface was originally designed in conjunction with the Naskapi community in the 1990s.  When it was subsequently re-encoded for Unicode, coverage was extended for all the Cree (and Ojibwa) languages. Thus all the Algonquian language family languages that use Unified Canadian Aboriginal Syllabics are covered by the BJCree glyph inventory. That is, Plains Cree [crk], Woods Cree [cwd], Swampy Cree [csw], Moose Cree [crm], East Cree Southern [crj], East Cree Northern [crl], Naskapi [nsk], Severn Ojibwe (Oji-Cree) [ojs], and Northwestern Ojibwe [ojb].

The family provides both Regular and Bold weights, and includes a basic Latin set of characters.


# Status

The fonts are currently in transition from a previous source format to a UFO-based workflow, and will be re-released under the SIL OFL (https://scripts.sil.org/OFL).

Since it's still in flux, please don't make derivatives at this stage.
